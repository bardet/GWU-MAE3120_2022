    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this special semester and the abundance of snow days, this lab is created to introduce you to some advanced instrumentation that we did not have time to cover otherwise. Here we will do a brief introduction to high-speed imaging, synchronization, and thermal imaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/EMSpectrumcolor.jpg\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-speed camera we will be using in this lab responds to the same spectrum than human eye between 400-700 nm (actually a bit broader for the camera). The infra-red camera is responsive between 7.5 and 13 µm. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles of high-speed imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "High-speed cameras have allowed tremendous discovery into complex physical processes. Digital cameras come in two ways: CCD and CMOS. The active area over which the signal is recorded is called a pixel. Due to different architectures, CMOS cameras are able to reach higher frame per second (fps) than CCDs. They can now go as fast as 20,000 fps at 1 Megapixel! Here you will use a state-of-the-art scientific camera (IDT NX3-S3) with a CMOS sensor that can record images at full frame (1280 × 1024 pixels) at 2,500 fps. In digital cameras, each pixel is connected to a DAC, with depth ranging between 8 and 24 bits. The IDT camera has a 10 bit sensor, i.e. the intensity of each pixel is discretized into 210 = 1024 values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recorded pixel intensity is proportional to exposure time (time for which pixel is active or integrating), the lens numerical aperture or f-stop, and sensitivity of your sensor. See your textbook (appendix B) for a good overview of numerical aperture and sensitivity. Here we will focus on exposure time. To record dynamic systems, motion blur should be minimized and hence the exposure time minimized, while still using the sensor dynamic range (# bits) in an optimal manner. With this camera, the exposure time can be decreased to down to 1 µs. To freeze motion of high speed moving objects, it is sometimes beneficial to bring an external light source, such as strobe light or laser. In this lab, you will experiment with pulsed LEDs to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "The frame rate (or how many images per second are acquired) is optimized for the problem at hand. Since the cameras have limited amount of memory onboard, the experimentalist has to compromise between recording time and temporal resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles of instrument synchronization with TTL pulses\n",
    "\n",
    "Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) is a class of digital signal used in digital circuits built from bipolar junction transistor (BJT). TTL is widespread in integrated circuits and used in many applications, such as computers, instruments, cell phones, etc. Due to its wide use, TTL logic levels are employed in circuit with no TTL integrated circuits. In fact, the logic levels are used to create digital words (i.e. bytes) and to synchronize instruments. The binary logical levels are presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | Logic Level |  Voltage  |                 |\n",
    "|:-:|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------------:|\n",
    "| 1 |      0      | 0 - 0.8 V |                 |\n",
    "| 2 |      1      |   2 Vcc   | Vcc = 5 V ± 10% |\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence any voltage between 0 and 0.8 V corresponds to a bit of 0 and any voltage between 2 and 5 V to a bit of 1. From this, it can be seen that digital words will look like square waves of varying duty cycle. The same protocol is also used for synchronizing and trigging instruments. However, to increase the resolution of the clock down to sub-ns, precise timing is based on either rising or falling edge of TTL pulses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both cameras and LEDs can be synchronized and triggered through special timing units, called time delay generators or timing boards. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles of IR imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "Infra-red imagers measure how the radiative properties of an object change with temperature. Hence, radiations from an object are used to infer temperature of the object. The advantages of radiation pyrometry are: it is a non-contact measurement; the sensor has very fast response time; very high temperatures can be detected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental equation for radiation from a body is the Stefan-Boltzmann equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $E$ is the emissive power radiated per unit area (W/m<sup>2</sup>), $\\epsilon$ is the emissivity (defined as a fraction of radiation emitted from a body, it varies between $0$ and $1$ and is $1$ for a blackbody), $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma = 5.669 \\times 10^{-8} \\frac{\\textit{W}}{\\textit{m}^2\\textit{K}^4}$, and $T$ is the surface absolute thermodynamic temperature in K. Here are tables of emissivity for common surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "|          Surface         | Aluminum (polished) | Aluminum (anodized) |    Glass    | Water (deep) |   Asphalt   | Human Skin |\n",
    "|:------------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:----------:|\n",
    "| *Emissivity, $\\epsilon$* | 0.03                | 0.84                | 0.62 - 0.95 | 0.95         | 0.85 - 0.93 | 0.97       |\n",
    "\n",
    "The IR camera you will use in the lab (FLIR A15) is capable of recording at 60 fps at 160 × 128 pixels. It can detect temperature between -40°C and 160°C with a sensitivity of 0.05 K. The ADC is 14 bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The camera is calibrated for an emissivity of 0.95, hence when you perform temperature measurements with it, you have to correct for emissivity or your results will be wrong. The indicated temperature, $T_{ind}$, is related to the voltage of each pixel with an assumed emissivity, $\\epsilon_{assumed}$ = 0.95. Due to actual emissivity of a body, $\\epsilon_{actual}$ the body temperature, $T_H$, is corrected for by:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab you will be rotating between stations where you will get to manipulate the equipment and discover their behavior. For some stations you will have to work with another group, use your time between runs to start answering the discussion questions. You will also not follow the order of the procedure chronologically. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part I - Principles of high-speed imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "With another groups (the TA will call you), you will now experiment with fundamentals of high-speed imaging. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here one student will be operating the catapult while the others will record images of the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Preliminary question**: Motion blur can be defined as when the object has moved across the sensor by at least one pixel. Assume that the object is a 2 cm diameter sphere, the diameter is imaged over 20 pixels, and it moves at 1 m/s. What should be the maximum exposure time, so that there is no motion blur?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe camera software is “Motion Studio x64”. On the right panel you can select the frame rate, exposure time, and more advanced options, such as gain of the sensor that we will not use here.<br><p></p> \n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tTo help you focus the camera lens, set the system in live mode, by pressing the “play” arrow. To be able to be transferred over the Ethernet cable, the camera is acquiring data at a lower frame rate, but the exposure time is corrects so you can optimize your settings here.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tFocus the camera lens on the hand of the person holding the ball. And optimize for brightness.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tOnce you have a good set of settings, note them and you acquire data by pressing the “record” button. The camera is now continuously recording and is waiting for your trigger signal (the “check mark” button next to play) to start acquiring the data.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tPress record and trigger and look at the sequence under the playback tab. If you are not happy with the results, either, the ball has moved too much between frames (increase frame rate), the ball is blurry (decrease exposure time).<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tRestart at *Step 4*, noting the parameters at each time, so you do not perform the same test twice, till you have good values that you will report in you lab report. When you restart in live mode, you erase the images saved in the internal memory and the software will ask you to confirm you meant to do so. Comment on the brightness of the system.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tTo save the data, press the Save symbol on the upper left. To save on memory and transfer time, only select the images of interest in the sequence. Save the data straight to your thumb drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part II - Instrument Synchronization\n",
    "\n",
    "With the same groups, you will now synchronize the camera to a strobe light to have brighter images with very short exposure times. This can be accomplished in a very crude way, with powerful flood light; however, in some applications the heat generated by the lights will be detrimental to the system and it is preferred to use pulsed lights. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect a BNC cable from output of “sync out” of the camera (square wave symbol with an arrow coming out) and monitor signal on oscilloscope when the camera is recording. What kind of signal do you observe? What is its amplitude?<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Note the frame rate and time the square wave is in high position. To which parameters do they correspond to on the camera control panel?<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now connect the “sync out” of the camera to the “sync in” of the LEDs, making sure they are set on “pulsed” mode. Hence, every time you record an image and send a TTL signal through the camera “sync out” the LEDs will turn on.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. With the LEDs pointing at your scene, what is the minimum exposure time you can now accomplish, while maintaining a good dynamic range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part III - Principles of IR imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "With another groups (the TA will call you), you will now experiment with fundamentals of thermal imaging. The camera can be operated by clicking on the “PvSimpleUISample” link on the desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test the effect of emissivity with the IR camera. For this, point the camera to the intersection of the white board and the wall; i.e. you should have both in your field of view. Take a snapshot with the computer. What do you observe? Explain why.<br><p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some materials reflect thermal radiation (similar to a mirror reflecting visible light). Move the camera around the lab till you find a material that reflects thermal radiation well. What is the material? Are you surprised? Explain why such materials are used in greenhouses."
